# C-plus-plus-implementations
Repository contains C and C++ implementations of various algorithms and data structures

# cacheList 
OOP implementation of double-sided linked list with iterators. Program realizes all basic functionalities of standard linked lists.

# solver 
Implementation of minmax algorithm for tic-tac-toe game. Program realizes games on boards up to 5x5.

# partitions
Implementation of algorithm that creates all possible partitions of prime number
- input -> 2 prime numbers a and b, a > b
- output -> all possible partitions of a into sum of prime numbers, where the biggest one is b
- example      input : 27 17
               output : 17+2+2+2+2+2
                        17+3+3+2+2
                        17+5+3+2
                        17+5+5
                        17+7+3
